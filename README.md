# Maps links in Brave Search

- Introduces a new tab on the search results page, which provides a link to your chosen maps service, showing the location related to your search query;
- Adds a button to the minimaps in the search results to open the location in your preferred maps provider;
- Adds a button to the "Place" snippet in the search results to open the location in your preferred maps provider (Brave already does this for getting directions from here).

This is the code repository for [Maps links in Brave Search extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/<pending>).

It's open source so you know what is being installed on your machine (you can also use [code extractor](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/chrome-extension-source-v/jifpbeccnghkjeaalbbjmodiffmgedin) on the extension directly).

If you have any issues with the extension or want to suggest a new feature, please let me know in the comments on the extension page or in this repository by [creating an issue](https://github.com/stignarnia/add-maps-links-brave-search/issues).

Many thanks to [Re-introduce google maps links to search page](https://github.com/mrakowski0/readd-gmaps-links-chrome-extension). I forked it to use as a template for this extension.

## Note

For some odd reason Windows Security flags `usersettings.js` (and therefore `index.html` since it includes it) as a `Wacatac` trojan. I have submitted it to Microsoft to be checked and hopefully they will remove the flag. In the meantime, [this](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/47e768b50327ce8a6767c649c5579f57949e2db4ac5a379099f93017cecdcbfa/detection) is the VirusTotal scan of the extension, which obviously doesn't find anything.
