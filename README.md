# Maps links in Brave Search

- Introduces a new tab on the search results page, which provides a link to your chosen maps service, showing the location related to your search query;
- Adds a button to the minimaps in the search results to open the location in your preferred maps provider;
- Adds a button to the "Place" snippet in the search results to open the location in your preferred maps provider (Brave already does this for getting directions from here).

This is the code repository for [Maps links in Brave Search extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/<pending>).
