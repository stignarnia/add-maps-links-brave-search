# Maps links in Brave Search

- Adds a tab to the search results page with links to your preferred maps provider for the location of the query;
- Adds a button to the minimaps in the search results to open the location in your preferred maps provider;
- Adds a button to the "Place" snippet in the search results to open the location in your preferred maps provider (Brave already does it for getting directions from here).
